These are scripts and programs I've written which usually address some need
that I have in my day to day activities.  They are Free.  You can take and do
with them what you want.  I've learned a lot by looking at what other people
have done and it's time for me to give back to the net community.  

I make no guarantee that these will work for everyone in everyplace.  
However the point is that they may come close to what you need to 
do.  With a little modification they may do exactly what you need. These
scripts are unsupported and like many things in life if you don't 
know what you're doing some of these programs could prove destructive in 
your environment.  Please read through them and understand what they do before
you blow something up.

Several of these programs will require you to modify them for your environment
before they will work.

What's here:
dsh.rb - My attempt to replicate the function of dsh on the old RS/6000 SP.
inetdoff.rb - Search inetd.conf files, look for and deactivate protocols.
buildsec - Parse inetd.conf and create appropriate entries in inetd.sec.
ldapgroup - Return users in a group, or a users' groups.
ldappush - Take a user from an old LDAP and migrate them to the new LDAP.
serverbase.rb - Functions I found myself doing a lot, so I put them in a lib.
netappchk.rb - Checks on netapp mounts to see if they are working.
rcmdsoff.sh - Checks for and turns off rcommands in inetd.conf
