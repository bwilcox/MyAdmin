# Woot!  Free Scripts!

These are scripts and programs I've written which usually address some need that I have (or had) in my day to day activities.  They are Free.  You can take and do with them what you want.  I've learned a lot by looking at what other people
have done so it's only fair to let others look at what I've done.

I make no guarantee that these will work for everyone in everyplace. However the point is that they may come close to what you need to do.  With a little modification they may do exactly what you need. These scripts are unsupported and like many things in life if you don't know what you're doing some of these programs could prove destructive in your environment.  Please read through them and understand what they do before you blow something up.

Several of these programs will require you to modify them for your environment before they will work.

## What's here:
* unix_admin: Things I wrote as a unix admin, some might still be useful.  Others probably not anymore but they are here for posterity.
* puppet: Scrips which might be useful for puppet work.
